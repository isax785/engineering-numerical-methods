# Equation Systems

Given a system of equations, the methods to solve it are presented. Generally speaking, the methods belonging to this section are aimed at solving the equation systems in the following form:

$$Ax=b$$

- $A$ : coefficient matrix;
- $x$ : vector of unknowns;
- $b$ : vector of intercepts.

On the basis of the equation type, the presented methods are divided between:
