# Readme

`Engineering Numerical Methods` is a collection of numerical methods aimed at solving the most common problems that can be encounterd in engineering applications.

The whole content is presented in form of **wiki**, with multiple markdown files fully linked together.

Practical examples are also provided to ease the comprehension of the presented methods and provide an insight of practical application.

## TODO

- [ ] `img` folder containing all the images to be linked in the `md` files
- [ ] identify and add license

- [ ] `py` script for index/links generation

## Development Guidelines

- method comparative based on execution **timing** 
- implement `wiki` (i.e. internal linking in all files)
  - master file connected to al the ones contained in subfolders
  - each file connected to its parent and children (if present)
- folder structure to be defined while going ahead with the implementation
- use `LaTeX` for formula
